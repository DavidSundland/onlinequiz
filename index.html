        <main>
            <p>Do you think you may have extra-sensory perception? Do you have a sixth sense which allows you to foresee events in a way that defies all scientific explanation? <span>Then take this quiz!</span> It will prove once and for all whether you have <span>"the gift"</span>! The quiz asks a series of questions, the answers to which exist only in the "brain" of the quiz's creator. If you can answer all of the questions correctly, then you either:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Truly have psychic powers and should be either worshipped as a god or avoided on the subway.</li>
                <li>Have taken the quiz enough times that you know all the answers, which makes you a cheat and a total loser, because the quiz is scarcely interesting enough to take once, let alone multiple times.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>If you take the quiz and get <em>any</em> answers wrong, then:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>You ain't got no ESP.</li>
                <li>You need to enroll in our simple, guarantee-free ESP course. For twelve easy payments of $99.99, we'll give you all kinds of information and teach you a bunch of important stuff about ESP, gullibility, and money management.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>So are you ready to take the quiz? <em>(We knew you were going to say that!)</em> Then all you have to do is to click the button below, and huge heaps of stuff will be revealed to you.</p>
