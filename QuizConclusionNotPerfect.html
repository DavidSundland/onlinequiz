                    <p>Well, you failed.  I'd like to say that there's no shame in that, but that is a lie.  Being psychic is not only the most important human trait, it's the <i>only</i> trait that has any value at all.  So yes, you should be ashamed of not getting every answer correct.</p>
                    <p>No true psychic would have gotten <i>any</i> questions wrong, but if you have some lame excuse and want to give the quiz another go, click on the "Quiz Me Again" button below.</p>
